==== Calling the Arkane API
To call an Arkane API endpoint, you need the URL and the bearer token of a user.

WARNING: The Arkane API can also be used with API keys instead of Bearer Tokens. Using this authentication method is only encouraged in small scripts.

=== Connect

==== WHAT

Arkane Connect is an endpoint specifically designed to perform common tasks with Arkane wallets. Connect was created as a way to perform tasks which are

. otherwise not possible due to security reasons, like creating signatures
. necessary by all applications, like linking wallets your client

Basically, Arkane Connect is a small web application without a central entry point. Calls to Arkane Connect are made by navigating to a specific url. Although you can use it by itself - by manually crafting the urls - we also provide a javascript SDK.  

==== HOW



NOTE: Make sure all query parameters are url encoded (ex. https://www.urlencoder.org/)
